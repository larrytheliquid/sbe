\begin{abstract}
This paper is first about a change in perspective: thinking about
termination proofs as defining an {\it intrinsic semantics}, resulting
in simpler metatheoretical definitions and providing free theorems.
This is analogous to the benefits obtained from taking advantage of
{\it intrinsic typing}.
The paper is second about showing how
adopting this change in perspective helped us prove a novel result:
that hereditary substitution for G{\"o}del's System T terminates.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

As type theorists we often find ourselves in the following situation.
We're studying some (hopefully) total lamba calculus. We define some
syntax as an inductive datatype. Then we write down the typing rules and semantics 
and other properties as relations. Some of our relations are propositional (described as a dependently
typed, or indexed datatype) and some are definitional (described as
one or more equations). For example we might have

\[
\begin{array}{lll}

\ascribe{e}{A} & \mbox{typing relation} & \mbox{propositional}\\
e \bigstep e' & \mbox{big-step reduction} & \mbox{propositional} \\ 
\fun{IsValue}(e') & \mbox{is a value} & \mbox{propositional}\\
{\el{A}(e)} & \mbox{realizability predicate} & \mbox{definitional}\\

\end{array}
\]
We then proceed to prove easy metatheorems like type safety (which is merely
preservation for a big-step semantics).

\paragraph{Big-Step Type Preservation}

$$
\all{\ascribe{e}{A}} e \bigstep e' \marr \ascribe{e'}{A}
$$



Unfortunately, our relationally specified semantics is not obviously
terminating, so we begin the more difficult task of proving its
termination.

\paragraph{Termination of Big-Step}

$$
\all{\ascribe{e}{A}} \ex{\ascribe{e'}{A}} e \bigstep e' \land \fun{IsValue}(e')
$$

To prove termination, we come up with the appropriate logical
relation~\cite{TODO} for our semantics, relating expressions to evidence
that they terminate as some value.
In this case we have a unary
logical relation on expressions, or a realizability
predicate~\cite{TODO}. You can prove termination as the composition of
evaluation of expressions into the logical relation, and reification
of termination evidence as a function from the logical relation.

\begin{displaymath}
    \xymatrix{
          {\forall (e : A)} 
          \ar[dr]_{\fun{termination}}
          \ar[r]^{\fun{evaluate}}
        & {\el{A}(e)}
          \ar[d]^{\large{\fun{reify}}}
\\      & {\exists (e' : A). ~ e \bigstep e' \wedge \fun{IsValue} ~ e'} }
\end{displaymath}

Many operational semantics have been proven to terminate using this
method. For example, the realizability predicate and associated lemmas
needed to prove that a big-step semantics terminates for G{\"o}del's
System T are well known. It is easy to understand and verify such
completed definitions and proofs, but coming up with the correct
realizability predicate and associated lemmas for a novel proof takes
ingenuity. 

As we got stuck in various places trying to prove a novel termination result
(that {\it hereditary substitution}~\cite{TODO} terminates for
G{\"o}del's System T), we were inspired by
{\it intrinsic typing}~\cite{TODO} as a means of simplifying our
metatheory and getting free theorems. With {\it extrinsic} typing you
define expressions ($e$), a separate extrinsic typing relation $\ascribe{e}{A}$, and prove
theorems ($P$) of the form:
$$
\all{\ascribe{e}{\con{Exp}}} \ascribe{e}{A} \marr P(e) $$

Rather than having this pair of arguments everywhere, one can dispense with
the terms ($e$), and instead use the typing relation $\ascribe{e}{A}$
as an intrinsicly typed representation of terms, simplifying theorems to
have the form:
$$
\all{\ascribe{e}{A}} P(e)
$$

Furthermore, as our big-step semantics is now defined on intrinsically
typed expressions, the result is already type-correct so we get the
theorem of {\bf Type Preservation} for {\it free}!

{\bf Now to the point:} 
Recall the ``termination'' arrow in the commutative diagram for our
logical relations proof above. By analogy to intrinsic typing, you
can think of the big-step relation on expressions as an
{\it extrinsic semantics}, and the termination proof as a function
that produces a witness that the extrinsic semantics terminates. Yet,
the termination proof can itself act as an {\it intrinsic semantics}! 
Just like with intrinsic typing, when we use an intrinsic semantics
statements of theorems become simplified. For example, we can rename
and restate our previous {\bf Termination} theorem, to more
appropriately reflect that it {\it defines} normalization (our
semantics) as a function from expressions of some type to values of
the same type:

\paragraph{Normalization}
$$
\all{\ascribe{e}{A}} \ex{\ascribe{v}{A}}
$$

By the same token, our diagram is also simplified.

\begin{displaymath}
    \xymatrix{
          {\forall (e : A)} 
          \ar[dr]_{\fun{normalize}}
          \ar[r]^{\fun{evaluate}}
        & {\el{A}}
          \ar[d]^{\large{\fun{reify}}}
\\      & \exists (v : A) }
\end{displaymath}

Notice the codomain of evaluation has become simpler. Formerely, it
was a realizability predicate ($\el{A}(e)$) that related the input
expression to the underlying extrinsic big-step semantics. Now, it has
become a Kripke model~\cite{TODO} ($\el{A}$) representing the
collection of {\it values} of the appropriate type! Thus, the normalization
theorem is the well-known technique of defining your (intrinsic)
semantics as Normalization by Evaluation (NbE)~\cite{TODO}.

\subsection{The Perspective of Termination Proofs as Intrinsic Semantics}

Our {\bf first major contribution} is the {\it perspective} of thinking of
termination proofs as defining an intrinsic semantics.
The similarities between realizability predicates and Kripke models are
readily apparent. Neither of these concepts are new, we merely wish
to point out that NbE falls out of thinking of the
realizability predicate-based termination proof of an {\it extrinsic}
operational semantics as (a rather complicated way of) defining an {\it intrinsic}
semantics.

Just as intrinsic typing simplifies statements of theorems, intrinsic semantics simplifies
theorems too. Moreover, intrinsic semantics also provides us with
{\it free} theorems, as shown in \refsec{TODO} and \refsec{TODO}!

\paragraph{Big-Step Determinacy}

$$
e \bigstep e' \marr e \bigstep e'' \marr e' \equiv e''
$$

Because our termination proof-based semantics is already a function,
we do not need to prove that it produces unique outputs.

\paragraph{Big-Step Predicate Preservation}

$$
\el{A}(e) \marr e \bigstep e' \marr \el{A}(e')
$$

One of the lemmas of a realizability predicate-based proof is showing that
the big-step semantics preserves satisfiability
of the predicate. This is analogous to type-preservation, but at the
level of the realizability predicate. Because an intrinsic semantics
does not need to thread through evidence of an extrinsic semantics, we
also get this theorem for free.

\subsection{Termination of Hereditary Substitution for G{\"o}del's System T}

Our {\bf second major contribution} is an example of how adopting the
perspective of intrinsic semantics helped us prove a conjecture:
that hereditary substitution for G{\"o}del's System T terminates.

Normally, you give a (e.g. big-step or small-step) semantics to
{\it expressions}. Instead, you can give a semantics to {\it values}
($\beta$-redex-free canonical terms) of a 
of a canonical type theory~\cite{TODO}. The semantics for values is
known as {\it hereditary substitution}~\cite{TODO}. Because values are
not closed under ordinary substitution (which would break the invariant that values
do not contain $\beta$-redexes), hereditary substitution
performs evaluation if the substitution would
result in a $\beta$-redex.

The standard purely syntactic approaches~\cite{TODO} of proving termination of
hereditary substitution have not scaled to recursive inductive types
(e.g. $\nat$). We were originally tempted to define an extrinsic
hereditary substitution relation and prove that it terminates directly.

\paragraph{Termination of Hereditary Substitution}

$$
\all{\ascribe{v}{A}, \sigma} \ex{\ascribe{v'}{A}} \hsub{v}{v'}
$$

Just like proving termination of big-step semantics, we would need to
come up with the correct definition of the realizability predicate,
and the associated lemmas that make the following diagram commute.

\begin{displaymath}
    \xymatrix{
          {\forall (v : A), \sigma} 
          \ar[dr]_{\fun{hsub}}
          \ar[r]^{\fun{ceval}}
        & {\el{A}(v)}
          \ar[d]^{\large{\fun{reify}}}
\\      & {\exists (v' : A). ~ [ \sigma ] v = v'} }
\end{displaymath}

Originally, we tried to prove this directly but got stuck at various
points in our attempts. Eventually, we adopted the perspective of the
would-be termination proof as an intrinsic semantics. Thus, our goal
becomes instead to define hereditary substitution directly as a
function.

\paragraph{Hereditary Substitution}
$$
\all{\ascribe{v}{A}, \sigma} \ex{\ascribe{v'}{A}}
$$

Note that the type of this high-level presentation of the function does
not seem to guarantee any kind of correctness. In \refsec{TODO}, the
correctness becomes apparent once contexts are mentioned explicitly.

Adopting an intrinsic semantics for expressions lead us to a Kripke
model and NbE. Fortuitously, adopting an intrinsic semantics for
values also leads us to the very same Kripke model, and we get to
reuse associated lemmas (e.g. reification). This leads us to making
the following diagram commute.

\begin{displaymath}
    \xymatrix{
          \all{\ascribe{v}{A}, \sigma}
          \ar[dr]_{\fun{hsub}}
          \ar[r]^{\fun{ceval}}
        & {\el{A}}
          \ar[d]^{\large{\fun{reify}}}
\\      & \ex{\ascribe{v'}{A}} }
\end{displaymath}

We get to reuse the arrow on the right. Our contribution is the arrow
on the top, performing ``canonical evaluation'' of values by injecting
them into the model and evaluating under an environment whenever a
variable is encountered. For expressions, a Kripke model allows
normalization to be defined by evaluation (NbE). For values, a Kripke
model allows hereditary substitution to be defined by canonical
evaluation (SbE). Hence, our slogan:
{\it Hereditary Substitution by Canonical Evaluation (SbE)}.

\subsection{Outline}

After a brief discussion about our notation, the rest of the paper is
structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf{\refsec{epred}}}
We review the definitions and state the theorems needed to prove termination of
an extrinsic big-step semantics for G{\"o}del's System T using a
realizability predicate.

\item{\bf{\refsec{emodel}}}
We review the definitions and prove the theorems needed to define an
intrinsic semantics for G{\"o}del's System T via NbE and a Kripke
model. We point out which theorems from \refsec{epred} that we get for
free.

\item{\bf{\refsec{vmodel}}}
We review why the extrinsic relational semantics for hereditary
substitution does not obviously terminate, and show what choices you
need to make when defining its realizability predicate. Instead of
proving termination in the more complex setting of extrinsic
semantics, we define hereditary substitution as an intrinsic
semantics.

\item{\bf{\refsec{list}}}
We show how to extend the intrinsic semantics to a language including
parametric inductive types (e.g. lists).

\item{\bf{\refsec{correctness}}}
We prove that normalization of expressions, defined in terms of
hereditary substitution, is sound and complete with respect to a
contextual equivalence relation for expressions.

\item{\bf{\refsec{related}}}
We discuss related work.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notation}

We define types and contexts for G{\"o}del's System T using a standard
BNF grammar in \reffig{gram}. However, we use intrinsically typed
terms instead of defining a grammar for expressions and an extrinsic
typing relation. Below is an example of the standard extrinsic typing
of expressions.

$$
e ::= ... ~ | ~ \con{zero} ~ | ~ \con{suc} ~ n ~ | ~ ...
$$

$$
\infer
  [successor]
  {\Gamma \vdash^E \con{suc} ~ n : \nat}
{
  \Gamma \vdash^E n : \nat
}
$$

Instead, we use the proof terms of our typing relation as
intrinsically typed terms.

$$
\infer
  [\con{suc} ~ n]
  {\type{\nat}}
{
  (n : \type{\nat})
}
$$

We label each premise with a variable to
the left of a colon, and the name of the typing rule shows how to use
it as a proof term by applying it to the premise labels.

The letter appearing as the superscript to the turnstyle is part of
the name of each intrinsic typing judgment. For example, $\vdash^E$
types expressions in \reffig{type}, $\vdash^V$ types values in
\reffig{typv}, and $\vdash^N$ types neutrals in \reffig{typn}.

Finally, we have taken care to ensure that all of our constructions
are easily formalizable. For this reason, we
use use De Bruijn~\cite{TODO} variables. For example, our typing rule
for functions does not explicitly bind its variable.

$$
\infer
  [\lam b]
  {\type{A \arr B}}
{
  (b : \ctype{A}{B})
}
$$

Additionally, proof that a De Bruijn variable of a particular type
exists in the context is given by the $\vdash^R$ judgment in
\reffig{typr}. Mentioning a variable in a term thus requires evidence
that the variable judgment is satisfied.

$$
\infer
  [\fun{var} ~ i]
  {\type{A}}
{
  (i : \typr{A})
}
$$

This paper is about 2 things:
1. Reducing the complexity of metatheory statements, and the number of
proofs necessary in the metatheory. This is done by analogy with
intrinsic typing, where we consider intrinsic semantics. Here we do
not introduce any new techniques, we just offer a change of
perspective and clarify what savings we get. In the scenario in
question this amounts to shifting from an extrinsic relational semantics and a
realizability predicate (here a unary logical relation) used to prove
termination, to an intrinsic functional semantics using a Kripke model
(which can be seen as a nullary logical relation).

2. Adopting the perspective of intrinsic semantics in order to simply prove
termination of hereditary substitution for G{\"o}del's System T. This
amounts to shifting our attention from defining a semantics for
expressions, to defining a semantics for canonicals, where we
fortuitously get to reuse the same Kripke model.

\section{Related Work}

Our termination proof is a novel model-theoretic result, but it
does not solve the proof-theoretic version of the same problem.
Nevertheless, we view our solution as somewhere in between a largely
model theoretic, and proof theoretic semantics, as it is a syntactic
model (rather than HA or CCC).
